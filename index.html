<h1>Operating system programming and source code community </h1>
<p>GitHub is a centralized platform. Centralized for developers all around the globe. A person can just host the repository created in Git to the whole world.  Using this, it increases the chances of better project development and in less time. GitHub provides you with the easiness of combining the changes and removes the headache of sharing the large code files. If GitHub is not there, you will face a series of challenges in order to work together as a team </p>

<p>I recommend github to students because it can ease your works and also you can learn a lot of things hear and it can make you works much better. </p>
